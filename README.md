# HelixRollTp
A fun and interesting game in which a ball bounces off a platform and the player tries to avoid red death parts whilst aiming to reach the bottom of the helix which is the end goal

This first version comes in two modes. A classic mode which goes on till the 10th level and a time attack mode in which you play with the aim to hit and break your best score in 20 seconds. 

This game is integrated with google play services where you can access the leaderboard to see your standing in relation to other players and also incorporated with Unity ads to help you take a break and cool out after hitting a death part. You get to break a platform if you cross two in a row.
